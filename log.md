### Day 0: September 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress:**
Added 'Resume' page to portfolio site & started learning Python

**Thoughts:**

### Day 1: October 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress:**
Learned about formatting strings and string manipulation

**Thoughts:**  <br />
The .format() method seems annoying to type out. <br />
For example:  <br />
  print( "Hello {}, you are {} years old!".format(name, 28) )

I like the new f strings method because it looks neater <br />
For example: <br />
  name = "Bob" <br />
  print( f"Hello {name}" )
