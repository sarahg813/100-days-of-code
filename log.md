# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress:**
Added 'Resume' page to portfolio site & started learning Python

**Thoughts:** 
- Happy with how the resume page looks in my portfolio
- Happy to start learning Python (again)! (I learned it before but I want to start making projects with it)
